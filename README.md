## 💼 Professional Experience

I completed a 2-month DevOps internship in Portugal, working on hands-on, low-impact tasks in AWS Cloud to improve stability and automate routine processes. I developed Python/Flask scripts with Boto3 for cache management (CloudFront and Redis) and automated notifications via Teams and Slack, and worked on CI/CD pipelines with GitLab Runner and crontab. I also created EC2 instances and subnets using Terraform, and configured routing tables and connectivity in hybrid DEV, QA, and PROD environments.

I participated actively in internal meetings, shadowed client calls to develop communication and teamwork skills, and aligned my work with senior analysts to understand the impact of actions on environments. This experience strengthened my cloud, DevOps, and infrastructure automation skills, while enhancing my ability to learn, adapt, and collaborate effectively.
